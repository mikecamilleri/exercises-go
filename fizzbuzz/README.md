# FizzBuzz

Variants of FizzBuzz are often used to test very rudimentary programming skills in any language. The question is usually something like, "Write a function that accepts an integer and prints Fizz if it is divisible by 3, Buzz if it is divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz if it is divisible by both."
